# Pt 1 - how does chlorination change the spectral composition of EEMS?
# princip-al component analysis to look at how chlorination altered spectral characteristics (EEMS)

###########
# Pt 2 - How does EEMS and Water Quality parameters predict DBP formation?
# thoughts:
# use machine learning algorythm to predict DBP parameters
# try multivraite linear model where
#[DBP] = theta0 + theta1x1+theta2x2
# where x = spectral and EEM characteristics, as well as water quality parameters (pH, anion concentrations, DOC)
